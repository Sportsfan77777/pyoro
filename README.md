Overview:
This is a copy of the Pyoro game which can be found on the internet on a variety of different
websites. (e.g. http://jayisgames.com/games/pyoro/, http://www.freeonlinegames.com/game/pyoro, 
I cannot find the original source of the game. It is not me. I did not design this game.)

In Pyoro, my interpretation is that you are a bird trying to survive a dangerous forest filled
with tasty, but dangerous fruit falling from the sky. The only way to survive is to eat the fruit
falling from the sky. If you don't eat the fruit, it will destroy some of your platform or
land on your head. If a fruit lands on your head, you die and the game is over.
If the fruit doesn't kill you, but it destroys some of your platform, this is bad
because if too much of your platform is destroyed, you will have less space to move. This
increases the chance of fruit falling on your head and killing you.

How to Run the Game:
As of now, the game can be run out of the Pyoro class, which holds the main method for the game.
I intend to add a .jar file and/or a makefile to simplify things.

How to Play the Game:
The controls are simple.
(1) "Spacebar" launches the the tongue
(2) "Left Arrow" moves the bird left
(3) "Right Arrow" moves the bird right
Note:
(A) You can't move if you're trying to eat a fruit.
(B) You must hold the spacebar down while launching the tongue.
(C) For scoring, the higher elevation you eat the fruit, the better. It doesn't matter what color
the fruit is, though in real life, don't eat weird-colored fruits.
(D) The different-colored fruit are not worth more points, but some colors can help you
more than others. 
(E) If you die, relax! It's just a game...You can press "n" for a new game and do this as many
times as you wish. See if you can beat your high score.

Bugs:
(1) Shooting your tongue high can sometimes add points even if no fruit is present there.
(2) You cannot launch your tongue to close to the right edge of the screen. (Think of 
this as the 'Pong' glitch at the top of the screen if you are familiar with the ancient 
game of 'Pong'.)
(3) While this does not affect the gameplay, the design of the code can be improved.
When I had originally worked on this project, I was not too familiar with design patterns.
It is on my to-do list to update the code to reflect the model-view-controller pattern so
that the code is more organized. This will make it easier to add features to the game,
should I choose to do so.
(4) If you find any other bugs, let me know in case I don't already know about them.
